    "We have not ran this notebook in full ourselves as on Snellius, it took us 30 hours to run all the experiments on 1 powerful GPU and 9 CPUs, and we have much worse hardware locally. We have however tested that each method is able to be executed for at least 1 iteration. Since, we are loading checkpoints for the available neural networks, we expect the running time to be a little shorter but it will still take a while. We have provided job files alongside in the repository that may be run on Snellius to obtain the same results as an alternative."
